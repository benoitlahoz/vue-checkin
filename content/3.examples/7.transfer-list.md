# Transfer List Example

This example demonstrates how to build a transfer list that reads a mocked CSV file, displays available headers, allows you to transfer headers to the right panel, and apply transformations to each header (e.g. split `name` into `firstname` and `lastname`).

::example-loader{:component="TransferList"}
::

## Features
- Mocked CSV data with headers (`name, age, city`)
- Display available headers and transfer them to the right panel
- For each transferred header, select a transformation from a dropdown (e.g. split name)
- Apply transformations and display the transformed data

## Usage
1. View the available headers from the mocked CSV
2. Transfer headers to the right panel by clicking "Transfer"
3. For each transferred header, select a transformation (if available)
4. Click "Apply Transforms" to see the transformed data

## Example CSV
```
name,age,city
John Doe,32,Paris
Jane Smith,28,Lyon
Alice Cooper,40,Bordeaux
```

## Transformations
- **name**: Split into `firstname` and `lastname`
- **age, city**: No transformation available (can be extended)

## Result
After applying transforms, the data will be displayed with the selected transformations applied to each row.
