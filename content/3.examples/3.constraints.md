# Constraints Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `createConstraintsPlugin` from `@vue-airport/plugins-validation` to enforce business rules on a registry of members.

## Features
- Uniqueness constraint (name must be unique)
- Maximum count constraint (max 5 members)
- Custom business rule (max 2 admins)
- Real-time error feedback

## How it works
- Try to add a member with a duplicate name, more than 5 members, or more than 2 admins to see the error feedback.
