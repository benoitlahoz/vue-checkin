VueAirport can be installed in any Vue 3 or Nuxt 3 project using your preferred package manager.

## Package Manager Installation

::steps
### Install the packages

VueAirport is organized as a monorepo with separate packages. Install what you need:

::code-group
```bash [npm]
# Core only
npm install vue-airport

# With base plugins
npm install vue-airport @vue-airport/plugins-base

# With DevTools
npm install vue-airport vue-airport-devtools
```

```bash [yarn]
# Core only
yarn add vue-airport

# With base plugins
yarn add vue-airport @vue-airport/plugins-base

# With DevTools
yarn add vue-airport vue-airport-devtools
```

```bash [pnpm]
# Core only
pnpm add vue-airport

# With base plugins
pnpm add vue-airport @vue-airport/plugins-base
```

```bash [bun]
# Core only
bun add vue-airport

# With base plugins
bun add vue-airport @vue-airport/plugins-base
```
::

::tip
**Recommended:** Install both core and plugins packages for the full VueAirport experience.
::

### Import the composable

Import `useCheckIn` from the core package:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useCheckIn } from 'vue-airport';

// Your component logic
</script>
```

### Import plugins (optional)

If you installed `@vue-airport/plugins-base`, import plugins separately:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useCheckIn } from 'vue-airport';
import { 
  createActiveItemPlugin,
  createValidationPlugin,
  createHistoryPlugin,
  createDebouncePlugin
} from '@vue-airport/plugins-base';

// Your component logic
</script>
```

### Start building

You're ready to go! Check out the [Examples](/examples) to see VueAirport in action.

## Requirements

::warning
VueAirport requires Vue 3.3+ or Nuxt 3+ for proper TypeScript support and composition API features.
::

### Vue 3 Projects

```json [package.json]
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vue": "^3.3.0",
    "vue-airport": "latest",
    "@vue-airport/plugins-base": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Nuxt 3 Projects

```json [package.json]
{
  "dependencies": {
    "nuxt": "^3.0.0",
    "vue-airport": "latest",
    "@vue-airport/plugins-base": "latest",
    "vue-airport-devtools": "latest"
  }
}
```

::tip
The `vue-airport-devtools` package provides automatic integration with Vue DevTools in Nuxt projects.
::

## TypeScript Support

VueAirport is written in TypeScript and provides full type definitions out of the box. No additional type packages are needed.

```ts
import { useCheckIn } from 'vue-airport';
import type { DeskCore, CheckInItem } from 'vue-airport';

interface MyData {
  label: string;
  value: number;
}

const { createDesk } = useCheckIn<MyData>();
const { desk } = createDesk('myDesk');

// Fully typed desk and items
const items: CheckInItem<MyData>[] = desk.getAll();
```

## Using Plugins

VueAirport includes built-in plugins in the `@vue-airport/plugins-base` package:

```ts
import { useCheckIn } from 'vue-airport';
import { 
  createActiveItemPlugin, 
  createHistoryPlugin,
  createValidationPlugin,
  createDebouncePlugin
} from '@vue-airport/plugins-base';

const { createDesk } = useCheckIn();
const { desk } = createDesk('myDesk', {
  plugins: [
    createActiveItemPlugin(),
    createHistoryPlugin({ maxHistory: 50 }),
  ]
});
```
